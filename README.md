This is an Arduino-based prototype for the LED controller.  
It offers a few different modes of operation centered around the use of three knobs to control the lights.

The final product will use raw AVR code (i.e. not using Arduino environment).  This prototype will help us
quickly test out new features which we can then port over to plain AVR.  As a side note, the final product 
will also be using rotary encoders for the knobs instead of potentiometers seen here, so the code will change.
